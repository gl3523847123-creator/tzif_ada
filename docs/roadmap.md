## Overview

This roadmap outlines planned enhancements and features for future TZif library releases. Items are prioritized based on user impact, architectural considerations, and platform support goals.

---

## v1.1.0 - Platform Expansion & Formal Methods (Q1 2026)

**Focus**: Complete cross-platform support, SPARK verification, and performance monitoring

### High Priority

#### 1. Fix GitHub Actions CI Workflow
**Status**: Known Issues
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

- Review and fix known issues in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Update CI workflow to match current build process
- Verify all test suites run correctly in CI
- Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline
- Test across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Update CI documentation

**Rationale**: Continuous integration is critical for maintaining code quality and catching regressions. Current CI has known issues that prevent it from validating pull requests and releases properly.

#### 2. Complete Windows Platform Support
**Status**: Engineered but not enabled
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

- Complete testing of `infrastructure-platform-windows.ads/adb`
- Verify TZif file path resolution on Windows
- Test timezone source discovery on Windows
- Add Windows-specific CI testing
- Update documentation to reflect full Windows support

**Rationale**: Windows platform code exists but needs thorough testing and validation before release. Critical for broad platform adoption.

#### 3. Add Cache Hit/Miss Statistics
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

- Add statistics tracking to `Infrastructure.Cache.Zone_Cache`
- Implement cache hit/miss counters
- Add cache efficiency metrics (hit rate, eviction count)
- Expose statistics via query interface
- Document performance monitoring best practices

**Rationale**: Production deployments need visibility into cache performance for tuning and monitoring. Helps users optimize cache size and usage patterns.

#### 4. SPARK Formal Verification
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: High
**Impact**: High (Safety-Critical Applications)

- Run GNATprove on domain and application layers
- Add SPARK contracts and proof annotations
- Verify absence of runtime errors
- Document proof obligations and coverage
- Achieve Silver or Gold level SPARK compliance
- Publish formal verification results

**Rationale**: TZif v1.0.0 is designed to support SPARK verification with pure domain logic, bounded types, and I/O isolation via generic plugins. Formal verification would enable adoption in safety-critical systems (avionics, medical devices, industrial control).

#### 5. Heap-Free Embedded Support
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: High
**Impact**: Medium (Embedded Systems)

- Replace Ada.Containers.Vectors with bounded containers
- Implement Ada.Containers.Bounded_Vectors for transitions/types
- Verify No_Implicit_Heap_Allocations compliance
- Test with embedded restriction pragmas
- Validate on STM32 targets
- Document memory footprint and limitations

**Rationale**: TZif v1.0.0 provides embedded profile templates, but domain layer currently uses heap-allocating containers. Bounded containers would enable true heap-free operation for safety-critical embedded systems requiring static memory allocation.

### Medium Priority

#### 6. Path Traversal Protection Audit
**Status**: Review Required
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: High (Security)

- Audit `Infrastructure.Paths.Canonical` implementation
- Verify protection against ".." path traversal attacks
- Add security-focused tests for path canonicalization
- Document security guarantees in API
- Consider adding path validation preconditions

**Rationale**: Security hardening for production use. Path canonicalization must be proven secure against directory traversal attacks.

#### 7. TZif File Size Limits (DOS Protection)
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium (Security)

- Add configurable maximum file size for TZif parsing
- Implement early rejection of oversized files
- Add configuration via `TZif_Config` package
- Document DOS protection mechanisms
- Add tests with large/malicious TZif files

**Rationale**: Prevents denial-of-service attacks via extremely large TZif files that could consume excessive memory during parsing.

---

## v1.2.0 - Testing & Quality Enhancements (Q2 2026)

**Focus**: Enhanced test coverage and performance validation

### Medium Priority

#### 8. Property-Based Testing for Parser
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

- Integrate property-based testing framework (consider adapting QuickCheck concepts)
- Generate randomized TZif files for parser testing
- Test parser invariants (round-trip, error boundaries)
- Catch edge cases not covered by example-based tests
- Document property testing approach

**Rationale**: Property-based testing excels at finding edge cases in parsers. Would significantly increase confidence in TZif parser correctness across all possible inputs.

#### 9. Performance Benchmark Suite
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

- Create benchmark suite for performance claims
- Verify O(1) lookup performance characteristics
- Measure cache hit/miss performance impact
- Benchmark parse times for different TZif versions
- Add regression testing for performance
- Document expected performance characteristics

**Rationale**: Current documentation claims O(1) performance. Benchmarks would validate these claims and prevent performance regressions in future releases.

## v2.0.0 - API Evolution & Advanced Features (Q3 2026)

**Focus**: Backward-compatible API enhancements and advanced timezone features

### Low Priority

#### 10. Port Versioning Strategy
**Status**: Planning
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low (Future-proofing)

- Document strategy for evolving port interfaces
- Consider versioned port packages (`Application.Port.V2.Inbound.Find_By_Id`)
- Plan deprecation policy for old ports
- Ensure backward compatibility path
- Create migration guide template

**Rationale**: Establishes clear path for API evolution without breaking existing users. Important for long-term library stability.

#### 11. Error Context Enrichment
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low

- Add operation context to error types
- Consider adding stack trace information
- Implement error chaining (cause tracking)
- Add source location information (file, line)
- Document debugging best practices

**Rationale**: Enhanced error diagnostics would aid production debugging. Useful for troubleshooting complex error scenarios.

#### 12. Advanced Timezone Queries
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: High
**Impact**: Low

- Add timezone offset queries (find zones with specific UTC offset)
- Implement DST transition queries (find next DST change)
- Add historical timezone data queries
- Support fuzzy matching for timezone names
- Consider adding timezone alias resolution

**Rationale**: Advanced queries would support more sophisticated timezone applications. Nice-to-have features for specialized use cases.

#### 13. Controlled Types for Resource Management
**Status**: Consideration
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Low

- Evaluate need for `Ada.Finalization.Controlled` types
- Consider for file handle management
- Document current resource management approach
- Plan for future cleanup actions if needed

**Rationale**: Current design doesn't need cleanup actions, but future enhancements might benefit from controlled types.

#### 14. Cache Persistence Investigation
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low

- Investigate performance benefits of persisted cache vs in-memory
- Evaluate SPARK compatibility of cache serialization
- Consider JSON vs binary cache formats
- Assess cache staleness and invalidation complexity
- Benchmark startup time with/without persisted cache

**Rationale**: Current in-memory cache performs excellently (20ms cold start). Persisted cache adds SPARK/I/O complexity. Implementation deferred pending user demand and performance requirements.

#### 15. Parallel Source Discovery Investigation
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low

- Evaluate performance benefits of parallel vs sequential discovery
- Design concurrent directory traversal architecture
- Implement thread pool for parallel validation
- Benchmark discovery time across different source counts
- Consider task safety and synchronization requirements

**Rationale**: Current sequential discovery is sufficient (5-15ms for typical sources). Parallel implementation adds concurrency complexity. Deferred pending user demand for faster discovery.

#### 16. Improved Infinite Loop Detection
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Low

- Investigate inode-based cycle detection
- Consider platform-specific implementations (POSIX stat, Windows file IDs)
- Compare performance vs canonical path tracking
- Evaluate portability trade-offs
- Document detection strategy in architecture guide

**Rationale**: Current canonical path + depth limit approach is portable and sufficient. Inode-based detection would be more robust but requires platform-specific code. Deferred pending evidence of issues with current approach.
