## v2.1.0 - Testing & Quality Enhancements (Q1 2026)

**Focus**: Enhanced test coverage, performance validation, and CI improvements

### High Priority

#### 1. Fix GitHub Actions CI Workflow
**Status**: Known Issues
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

- Review and fix known issues in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Update CI workflow to match current build process
- Verify all test suites run correctly in CI
- Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline
- Test across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Update CI documentation

**Rationale**: Continuous integration is critical for maintaining code quality and catching regressions.

#### 2. Add Cache Hit/Miss Statistics
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

- Add statistics tracking to `Infrastructure.Cache.Zone_Cache`
- Implement cache hit/miss counters
- Add cache efficiency metrics (hit rate, eviction count)
- Expose statistics via query interface
- Document performance monitoring best practices

**Rationale**: Production deployments need visibility into cache performance for tuning and monitoring.

#### 3. Infrastructure Layer Refactoring
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (Maintainability)

Review and refactor large infrastructure files exceeding 800-line threshold:
- `infrastructure/adapter/file_system/tzif-infrastructure-adapter-file_system-repository.adb` (1204 lines)
- `infrastructure/io/desktop/tzif-infrastructure-io-desktop.adb` (1178 lines)
- `infrastructure/io/windows/tzif-infrastructure-io-windows.adb` (1119 lines)
- `infrastructure/io/embedded/tzif-infrastructure-io-embedded.adb` (1092 lines)

Consider:
- Extract common patterns into shared helper packages
- Split platform I/O into smaller focused units
- Reduce code duplication across platform adapters
- Maintain SPARK compatibility in refactored code

**Rationale**: Large files are harder to maintain, review, and test. Refactoring improves code organization and reduces cognitive load for future development.

### Medium Priority

#### 4. Path Traversal Protection Audit
**Status**: Review Required
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: High (Security)

- Audit `Infrastructure.Paths.Canonical` implementation
- Verify protection against ".." path traversal attacks
- Add security-focused tests for path canonicalization
- Document security guarantees in API
- Consider adding path validation preconditions

**Rationale**: Security hardening for production use. Path canonicalization must be proven secure against directory traversal attacks.

#### 5. TZif File Size Limits (DOS Protection)
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium (Security)

- Add configurable maximum file size for TZif parsing
- Implement early rejection of oversized files
- Add configuration via `TZif_Config` package
- Document DOS protection mechanisms
- Add tests with large/malicious TZif files

**Rationale**: Prevents denial-of-service attacks via extremely large TZif files that could consume excessive memory during parsing.

---

### Medium Priority

#### 6. Test Coverage Expansion
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

- Increase unit test coverage for domain services
- Add boundary condition tests for timezone lookups
- Add error path tests for Option return values
- Add tests for all error kinds (Parse_Error, Not_Found_Error, IO_Error, etc.)
- Document test coverage metrics and goals

**Rationale**: Code review identified areas where additional test coverage would improve confidence in error handling and edge cases.

#### 7. Exception Handler Audit
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

- Audit all silent exception handlers marked with DELIBERATE comments
- Verify each handler is truly benign (not swallowing real errors)
- Consider adding telemetry/logging hooks for exception tracking
- Document exception handling policy
- Update handlers if patterns cause data loss

**Rationale**: Silent exception handlers in directory scanning are intentional but should be periodically reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate as the codebase evolves.

#### 8. Property-Based Testing for Parser
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

- Integrate property-based testing framework (consider adapting QuickCheck concepts)
- Generate randomized TZif files for parser testing
- Test parser invariants (round-trip, error boundaries)
- Catch edge cases not covered by example-based tests
- Document property testing approach

**Rationale**: Property-based testing excels at finding edge cases in parsers. Would significantly increase confidence in TZif parser correctness across all possible inputs.

#### 9. Performance Benchmark Suite
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

- Create benchmark suite for performance claims
- Verify O(1) lookup performance characteristics
- Measure cache hit/miss performance impact
- Benchmark parse times for different TZif versions
- Add regression testing for performance
- Document expected performance characteristics

**Rationale**: Current documentation claims O(1) performance. Benchmarks would validate these claims and prevent performance regressions in future releases.

## v3.0.0 - API Evolution & Advanced Features (Q2 2026)

**Focus**: Backward-compatible API enhancements and advanced timezone features

### Low Priority

#### 1. Port Versioning Strategy
**Status**: Planning
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low (Future-proofing)

- Document strategy for evolving port interfaces
- Consider versioned port packages (`Application.Port.V2.Inbound.Find_By_Id`)
- Plan deprecation policy for old ports
- Ensure backward compatibility path
- Create migration guide template

**Rationale**: Establishes clear path for API evolution without breaking existing users. Important for long-term library stability.

#### 2. Error Context Enrichment
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low

- Add operation context to error types
- Consider adding stack trace information
- Implement error chaining (cause tracking)
- Add source location information (file, line)
- Document debugging best practices

**Rationale**: Enhanced error diagnostics would aid production debugging. Useful for troubleshooting complex error scenarios.

#### 3. Advanced Timezone Queries
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: High
**Impact**: Low

- Add timezone offset queries (find zones with specific UTC offset)
- Implement DST transition queries (find next DST change)
- Add historical timezone data queries
- Support fuzzy matching for timezone names
- Consider adding timezone alias resolution

**Rationale**: Advanced queries would support more sophisticated timezone applications. Nice-to-have features for specialized use cases.

#### 4. Controlled Types for Resource Management
**Status**: Consideration
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Low

- Evaluate need for `Ada.Finalization.Controlled` types
- Consider for file handle management
- Document current resource management approach
- Plan for future cleanup actions if needed

**Rationale**: Current design doesn't need cleanup actions, but future enhancements might benefit from controlled types.

#### 5. Cache Persistence Investigation
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low

- Investigate performance benefits of persisted cache vs in-memory
- Evaluate SPARK compatibility of cache serialization
- Consider JSON vs binary cache formats
- Assess cache staleness and invalidation complexity
- Benchmark startup time with/without persisted cache

**Rationale**: Current in-memory cache performs excellently (20ms cold start). Persisted cache adds SPARK/I/O complexity. Implementation deferred pending user demand and performance requirements.

#### 6. Parallel Source Discovery Investigation
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Low

- Evaluate performance benefits of parallel vs sequential discovery
- Design concurrent directory traversal architecture
- Implement thread pool for parallel validation
- Benchmark discovery time across different source counts
- Consider task safety and synchronization requirements

**Rationale**: Current sequential discovery is sufficient (5-15ms for typical sources). Parallel implementation adds concurrency complexity. Deferred pending user demand for faster discovery.

#### 7. Improved Infinite Loop Detection
**Status**: Proposed
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Low

- Investigate inode-based cycle detection
- Consider platform-specific implementations (POSIX stat, Windows file IDs)
- Compare performance vs canonical path tracking
- Evaluate portability trade-offs
- Document detection strategy in architecture guide

**Rationale**: Current canonical path + depth limit approach is portable and sufficient. Inode-based detection would be more robust but requires platform-specific code. Deferred pending evidence of issues with current approach.
