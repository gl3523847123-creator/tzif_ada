- Query operations for timezone data by ID, region, pattern, and regex
- Timezone transition lookups for specific epochs
- Source discovery and validation
- High-performance in-memory caching
- Thread-safe operations
- Railway-oriented error handling

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

TZif is a standalone Ada library implementing hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture with clean separation between domain logic, application use cases, and infrastructure adapters.

**Architecture Layers**:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Domain | Pure business logic, value objects, entities |
| Application | Use cases, ports (interfaces) |
| Infrastructure | Adapters for file system, parsing |
| API | Public facade with stable interface |

### 2.2 Product Features

1. **TZif Parsing**: Parse TZif v2, v3 binary files (RFC 9636)
2. **Timezone Queries**: Find by ID, region, pattern, regex
3. **Transition Lookups**: Get timezone info for specific epoch
4. **Source Management**: Discover and validate timezone sources
5. **In-Memory Caching**: High-performance zone caching with automatic invalidation
6. **Error Handling**: Railway-oriented programming with Result monads

### 2.3 User Classes

| User Class | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Application Developers | Integrate timezone functionality into applications |
| System Administrators | Configure timezone data sources |
| Library Maintainers | Extend and maintain the codebase |

### 2.4 Operating Environment

| Requirement | Specification |
