### Architecture
- Domain layer: Pure business logic with zero dependencies
- Application layer: Use cases, ports, commands
- Infrastructure layer: Adapters (Console_Writer)
- API layer: Public facade with platform-specific instantiations
- Library_Standalone mode with explicit Library_Interface
- Static dispatch via generics for zero-overhead DI
- SPARK_Mode boundaries defined for future formal verification

### Dependencies
- functional ^2.1.1 (Result/Option/Try monads)
